## The Problem

There is an overabundance of technologies that can be used to build a fullstack web application. Junior engineers often have insufficient knowledge of the current options and are stuck with analysis paralysis as they try to build their own application.

## The Solution

StackGen is a web application that asks users a series of questions about the application they want to build, then provides a suggested tech stack for them to consider using and to research further into.

Our application is a simple all-in-one tool where you can take advantage of the knowledge of experienced engineers to give yourself confidence in the technologies you choose for your fullstack application.
